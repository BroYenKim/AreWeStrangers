Hello,

My name is Brian Kim, a USC student majoring in Computer Science (Games).

Are We Strangers is a personal project that I chose to tackle in Summer of 2020. 
The game is a web game based on "We're not Really Strangers". I chose to tackle 
this project because since we're currently in the Coronavirus outbreak and we have 
to social distance from each other, I wanted to show that even if we are apart, we 
can still build and maintain connections.

To be honest, this was a project that took longer than I had hoped because it went
through some architectural design changes. Initially I wanted to showcase what I
had learned in my CS 201 class by using servlets to communicate between players
and the server, along with storing the question bank in the database. However, it 
has proven to be difficult when I tried to add multiplayer functionality. In order 
to make this project into a reality, I learned Node.js through YouTube videos and 
essentially rebuilt the entire game in that fashion. 

Are We Strangers' front end was built with HTML and CSS, and the back-end was built 
using Express and Node.js as the framework, Socket.io for managing players and rooms, 
and Javascript for gameplay. 

Are We Strangers is hosted on AWS. I learned AWS in Summer of 2019 when I studied
and took the test for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate Exam.
