<div>Are We Strangers?</div>
<div>Play</div>
<div>This is a non profit, fan made game based on <a href="https://www.werenotreallystrangers.com/">We're Not Really Strangers (WNRS)</a>, a card game created by LA Artist and Model <a href="https://www.instagram.com/koreen/">Koreen</a>. As stated on their site, WNRS is a card game with the "intention of empowering meaningful connections with others."</div>
<div>This COVID-19 epidemic made me recognize the importance of human connections and maintaining our relationships, so I thought it would be appropriate to create a web version of this game to remember that even when we're physically apart, we can still be together.</div>
<div>If you enjoyed this game and want to show support, please consider buying the physical copy of the game on their site, as playing it in person will provide a different intimate experience. </div>
<div>The rules of this game are simple. There can be anywhere between 2 - 6 players, and the game is divided into 3 levels.</div>
<div>Each level there are a deck of random questions, and the higher round you are in the more intimate the questions become. Each turn, one player will draw a card and ask that question to another player, and players will alternate until they have finished the round. When the final round finishes, there will be one more task that you will have to do (which I will keep secret), and after that you have finished the game.</div>
<div>Are you ready to be vulnerable?</div>
